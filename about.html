                <h3>Founding History</h3>
                <p>Packaged Hearts was founded in November 2023 by Varsha Jagadeesh as a small family initiative. Beginning with local fundraisers and distributions in Fresno, San Francisco, and Oakland, we have since expanded across the West Coast. Our journey continues as we formalize our organization to offer a reliable platform for community involvement in assisting homeless populations.</p>
